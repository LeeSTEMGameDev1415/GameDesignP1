It was dark in the room she was in, the only light was the light that shined under the door. Her left arm had finally gone numb and she couldn’t see in her right eye. She continued to use the last of her remaining strength to reach for the door, blood gushed out of her leg. 

The girl pulled herself up to the door, resting her hand in the light. 

“Help…” she groaned in a weary voice.

Her breathing slowed, becoming more painful. She closed both her eyes. The young Jamie, rested her hand in the light that shone under the door. She took one last painful breath before her heart stopped, ending her life.
