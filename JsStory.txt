Once upon a time, there was a class where the students used Notepad and MS Paint instead of Microsoft Word and GIMP. Everyone was super turnt on
Tuesdays, so they didn't get much work done. However, on Mondays, there was nothing better to do than ramble aimlessly. It just so happened that
was the assignment! How lucky the students were! And then they all listened to Party With the Devil by Attila, even though they weren't Satanic
at all. They all lived questionably ever after.
