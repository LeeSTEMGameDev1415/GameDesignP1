The year is 1952 Michael and Alison had only known each other for about a week now But they already had a strong fire burning for each other. Her father did not approve of her having a boyfriend at the age of  15 but she knew her relationship with Michael was more than just boyfriend and girlfriend . They had already made plans to run away with each other in the summer. They would move from Oklahoma to Dallas Texas. Finally summer came and she waited by the big oak tree where her and Michael were supposed to meet but he never showed. All through summer she never saw him and he never came to her house. Finally school started and he wasn't there either She began to worry so she went to his house.  His mother answered the door and said she had not seen her boy since the first day of summer. She walked back home crying thinking he had ran away regretting ever making plans with her. Than all of a sudden she saw him walk into the woods. She ran towards him asking him where he had been but when she finnaly  reached where he was standing he was gone like he was never there. Every day she walked down the same path after school but never found any sign of him being there. Until one day she found a note in the woods. The note was titled To Michaela, my one true love. The note explained that her father had spoken to him the night before they ran away and had told him that if he took his daughter to Texas he would find them and send any children they had to the orphanage. Knowing they would always be on the run it would be best if she found someone knew who her father fully trusted. He just wanted her to have a happy comfortable life. So he had hung himself in the woods knowing he could never give her the life she wanted. crying out of anger and dispare Alison Searched for his body for days wanting to give him a proper burial. After wasting hours of searching  she finally decided it would be no use she wanted to see him one more time. She decided to also taker her own life Since technically it was her fault that he had died in the first place because it was her that he fell in love with. Grabbing a strong vine she wrapped it around her neck and swung it over a tree to tie it to the ground. She began  to climb the tree and as  soon as she jumped off she saw him. She saw Michael running towards her crying with his shirt ripped and his face bloody. She was so high up in the air HE tried to climg the tree as he was explaining to her how her father had abducted him and kept him in the cellar tied up. Her father Was to let him go only if he agreed to leave town and to never speak to his daughter again. As soon as he reached the vine atop the tree she stopped struggling. Alison's body lay limp and Michael began screaming in rage at her father. He took her down and lay her body in the dirt He himself slit his wrists and died beside her. Some say you can see them holding hands in the forest at night. The creepiest part is that nobody saw her father after that day. And nobody ever found the bodies.
