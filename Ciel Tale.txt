A black bat liked dragon lived in the underworld. He wished to walk like to other dragons but he has no legs. Instead he had a claw on the end of his wings and tail. As he atemped to roar like the 
other dragons his roar was the oddest out of them all, for he sounded simaler to a crying bat.Unlike the other dragons he had exordinary powers having the abilty to teloport, create black holes,
and use his cry to fly.
