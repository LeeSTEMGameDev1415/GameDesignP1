Once there was a patriotic man named Bob, he was so patriotic that 
he could take down thousands of enemy soldiers just by snapping his fingers.
Bob received multiple heroic awards and became the new special forces unit for the US.
Problem was Bob's special ability only works in the UNited States where it is patriotic everywhere.
When Bob went onto his first mission out fo the states, he was never seen again.
